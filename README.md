# NBS Tunes for CC
Easily parse any version of the Note Block Studio (.nbs) music format in ComputerCraft!

Features:
- can parse each version (0-5) of the .nbs format!
- parse just the format for raw data, or load the file as music to be played in your project/game easily
- custom instruments (not just noteblock sounds, but also any sound in Minecraft)
- music looping (from any starting point)

Try it out by running play.lua to hear Doritos and Fritos!

You can include the nbsTunes.lua file in any of your projects without asking for permission :)
